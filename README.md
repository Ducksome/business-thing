# For Paarth and Dev

Please add any major things you add over here in the README.md file.

## CSS ROOT

The root CSS file is now App.css. Here, you can configure the default font, primary color(s) and more you want to add. Please change it.

I have added 4 colors:

- Primary (Purple) (pls change it to something cool)
- Danger (red)
- Success (green)
- Info (blue)
