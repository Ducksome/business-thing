## CSS ROOT

The main SCSS file is now style.scss (assets/styles/style.scss). Here, you can configure the default font, primary color(s) and more you want to add. Please change it.

I have added 4 colors:

- Primary (Purple) (pls change it to something cool)
- Danger (red)
- Success (green)
- Info (blue)
